<h2>PDF Annotation and Reading Android Application</h2>

<p>This Android application is designed to facilitate efficient reading and annotating of PDF documents. It offers features such as highlighting, commenting, bookmarking, and text selection, all aimed at enhancing the user's experience with PDF files.</p>

<h2>Key Features:</h2>

<ol>
  <li><strong>PDF Reading and Annotation:</strong> The application allows users to read PDF files seamlessly while adding annotations such as highlights, comments, and bookmarks. These annotations help users abstract and organize important information within the PDF documents.</li>
  <li><strong>PDF Management:</strong> Users can import PDF files either by selecting them from local storage or by downloading them directly from a URL. Once added, the PDFs are stored in a local database, ensuring they remain accessible until intentionally deleted by the user or when the app data is cleared.</li>
  <li><strong>Tagging System:</strong> Users can categorize PDF files by adding tags, making it easier to group and manage documents based on specific topics or themes. This feature enhances organization and allows for quick retrieval of relevant PDFs.</li>
  <li><strong>Custom PDF Rendering:</strong> To enable text selection and annotation, the application combines two librariesâ€”one for rendering PDFs and another for extracting characters and their coordinates from the documents. This custom approach ensures robust functionality, although it may lead to longer loading times for larger PDFs. However, pagination functionality is planned to be implemented soon, which will significantly improve the loading speed of large PDFs.</li>
</ol>

<h2>Upcoming Enhancements:</h2>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Pagination:</strong> The addition of pagination will optimize the PDF reading experience by allowing for faster loading of large documents.</li>
  <li><strong>Performance Improvements:</strong> Continual efforts will be made to enhance the application's performance, ensuring smooth and efficient operation across various devices and PDF file sizes.</li>
</ul>
